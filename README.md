# ðŸ˜Š Real-Time Emotion Detection System

A **Python-based Deep Learning project** that detects human emotions from facial expressions in **real-time** using a webcam.  
This system leverages **OpenCV** for face detection and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **FER-2013 dataset** to classify emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, and Neutral.


## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects emotions from live webcam feed  
- Uses Haar Cascade for face detection  
- Real-time classification with CNN model  
- Displays detected emotion on screen  
- Supports 7 emotion classes  

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset:** FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition dataset)


## ðŸ§© Model Overview
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Input:** Grayscale facial images (48x48)  
- **Output:** Predicted emotion label  
- **Emotions Classified:** Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
